    # Module 1
    ---

    This first module is an introduction to python/Anaconda as a programming language. In this first section we see
    the basic data structures and type of data.

    With this context, I pretend to have a briebdly and clear introduction to concepts that I dont known and it´s strange.

    ## Basic Code 

    ```python

    sentence : String= "Who would have thought that we were robots all along?"
    sentence[:4]
    sentence[-6:]
    sentence[5:22]

    # Validation
    "robot" in sentence

    # Num counter 
    sentence.count('w')

    # Remplace strings 
    sentence.replace("robot", "computer")

    # Slicing 
    my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
    my_list[:3] = "abc"
