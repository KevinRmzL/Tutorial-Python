>Kevin Alejandro Ramírez Luna | 12/12/2025

A tutorial covering Python's basic concepts. The examples were taken from [this page](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/intro.html), highlighting what I found most relevant or tend to forget from the topics presented.

The repository is divided following the next structure:
1. Module 1 - Getting Started 
2. Module 2 - Essentials of python 
3. Module 3 - Problems (like leetcodes)
4. Module 4 - POO
5. Module 5 - Odds and ends
6. tutorial-env - Python enviroment 

**Extras: docstrings and type_hints files**
